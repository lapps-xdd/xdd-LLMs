The research found that the lowest ratios of methylation activity were in fetal liver from summer breedings and in placental tissues from winter breedings. The relative expression of certain genes in placental and fetal tissues was affected by the interaction of breeding and semen collection seasons. The study concludes that seasonality of semen collection, breeding, and the effect on sperm head shape change had an influence on the expression of genes with known differentially methylated regions or response to methylation activity from embryonic and extraembryonic tissues."}

Additionally, individuals with an early DNR order were less likely to spend time in intensive care, receive a palliative care consultation, be restrained, have a bladder catheter, or die in the hospital, and were more likely to be discharged home. The study concluded that there is a strong association between the presence of a DNR order and mortality, and further research is needed to better understand the presence and timing of DNR orders in hospitalized older adults."}
