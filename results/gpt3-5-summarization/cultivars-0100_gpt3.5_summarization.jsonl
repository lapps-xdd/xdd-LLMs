The extreme value models are applied to estimate 20-yr return values of maximum daily temperature over Europe in transient global climate model (GCM) simulations for the 21st century. The study compares scenarios of changes in the 20-yr return temperatures based on non-stationary peaks-over-threshold models with conventional stationary models, demonstrating that the non-stationary models lead to more robust spatial patterns and enable the detection of areas with the largest projected warming in the tail of the distribution of daily temperatures. The method also allows for the splitting of the projected warming of extremely high quantiles into two parts that reflect changes in the location and scale of the distribution of extremes, with spatial patterns of the two components differing significantly in the examined climate change projections over Europe.

The study uses a physically based semidistributed model to examine how changes in precipitation and temperature will affect streamflow and subsequently impact stream ecology. The results indicate that earlier snowmelt and reduced snowpack will increase discharge in the winter and early spring, but decrease monthly streamflow later in the spring. These changes in streamflow could potentially impact aquatic organisms and stream ecology. The assessment of streamflow seasonality and variability is important for drinking water supply watersheds and to assess the health of watershed streams."}
