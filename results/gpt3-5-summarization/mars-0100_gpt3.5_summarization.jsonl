The characterization of aqueous alteration of basalts under a variety of environmental conditions provides a conceptual framework for interpretation of similar relic environments on Mars. Finally, while identification of phyllosilicates on Mars is generally thought to require neutral to alkaline fluids, we documented significant formation of these minerals in the acidic volcanic systems. This study provides insight into the environmental controls on acid-sulfate alteration at active volcanoes in Nicaragua and their potential applications to relic hydrothermal systems on Mars."}
