These beds, found in upper Pliocene fluvial strata, are believed to have formed from high-temperature geothermal fluid that flowed through bedrock or from a deep-crustal source. The fluid is thought to have upwelled along the East Rincon Hills fault, flowed laterally at or just below the surface, and precipitated opal due to rapid cooling and evaporation. The study of these chemically precipitated sedimentary rocks can provide valuable information about basin-scale depositional architecture, paleoclimate, and groundwater composition and flow paths."}

Most subduction slabs plunge into the mantle at different angles, but flat-slab subduction moves horizontally for several hundred kilometers before diving into the hotter mantle. A comparative assessment of the Mexican, Peruvian and Chilean flat-slab subduction zones found several parameters that facilitate slab flattening, including trench roll-back and variations in the structure of oceanic and overriding plates. However, the necessary conditions for the formation of flat slabs in all three zones were not found. A numerical approach considering the influence of surrounding plates and their geometries on 3D subduction dynamics may be necessary to understand the origin of flat-slab subduction."}

The study shows that in the positive phase of NAO, the stratospheric polar vortex is stronger and colder than in the negative phase. The model NAO index decreases significantly from 1990 to 2015, coinciding with enhanced vertical stationary wave propagation and a dynamical heating of the northern polar stratosphere. This suggests that changes in tropospheric circulation might influence stratospheric dynamics and hence northern hemisphere ozone evolution. The study also notes that the evolution of polar ozone will not only depend on stratospheric halogen loading, but also on stratospheric changes resulting from greenhouse gas increases."}

In contrast, abandoned shrimp ponds only stored 11% of the carbon compared to mangroves. The conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds resulted in one of the largest measured carbon emissions from land use in the tropics.

The study also found that the extent to which the cloud deck penetrates inland is closely related to the coastal orography. The study used a long-term regional climate model to explain the observed variability and found that the model, despite generally underestimating cloudiness, was able to represent the diurnal cycle realistically.

This volcanism is believed to be the result of rapid heating of the mechanical boundary layer, which could have been caused by the convective removal of the lower lithosphere and its replacement by asthenosphere. This process could have raised the surface height of the plateau by 1-3 km and provided the driving force for extension. This rapid increase in surface height could not have been achieved by changes in crustal thickness, but rather by the convective removal of a substantial thickness of lower continental lithosphere."}

The models vary greatly in their ocean models, with some including effects of surface waves, Langmuir circulations, submesoscale eddies, and additional wind mixing. Most models significantly underestimate summer MLDs, with only a few having deeper MLDs in the Southern Ocean, central North Atlantic Ocean, and central North Pacific Ocean. This underestimation is not due to sea surface forcing, but potentially due to insufficient vertical mixing in the upper ocean. The surface mixed layer is crucial in the global climate system, affecting exchanges of heat, momentum, and energy between the ocean and atmosphere. However, many numerical models have deficiencies in simulating the surface mixed layer."}

Bush proposed increased research and development for capture, storage, and sequestration technology to address the rising levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Despite the Bush administration and Congress's reluctance to directly link GHG levels to climate change, many industry representatives have already completed projects that have significantly reduced GHG emissions. However, more action is needed to reverse or minimize the effects of climate change. Sequestration activities can be undertaken by industries at a minimal cost. The text also explains that climate change does not only mean global warming; it can also lead to a decrease in temperature in some areas. The greenhouse effect, caused by the composition of our atmosphere, increases the average global temperature. The theory of global warming was first proposed in 1896 by Svante August Arrhenius, who observed a correlation between the increase in CO2 levels and global temperature rise due to industrial production and fossil fuel consumption. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established to address GHGs and stated in 1995 that human activities have a discernible influence on global climate. Climate change can lead to warmer summers, colder winters, extreme weather events, precipitation fluctuations, increased desertification, and species shifts."}

The models were found to be more responsive to hydrological anomalies than observations. The study found higher mean correlations between global annual anomalies of gross primary productivity (GPP) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) in models than observations. The maximum correlation between GPP and SPI across different time scales was also higher in models than observations. The study also found stronger excursions of GPP to extreme dry or wet events. The models' over-response was smaller when evaluated based on surface soil moisture anomalies (SMA) instead of SPI. The study calls for improvement in understanding the dynamics of plant-available water and how vegetation responds to these anomalies."}

It suggests that these fluctuations were linked to changes in the mid-oceanic ridge systems, implying episodic plate motion. The author rejects the idea of marine cycles of strongly diachronous transgression, instead suggesting that episodes of eustatic transgression were short-lived. The text also discusses the relationship between major Cretaceous transgressions and regressions and contemporary magnetic polarity reversals, orogeny, and continental volcanism. The effects of eustatic fluctuations on Cretaceous oceanic sedimentation, nutrient input into the marine environment, palaeoclimate, and biological phenomena are also explored."}

This article explores the potential consequences of expanding bioenergy crop production in Austria, given the limited availability of arable land. The study found that expanding bioenergy crop production for biofuels would result in significant adjustment costs for the agricultural sector and impact land use and fertilizer intensity levels. The economic analysis also revealed that subsidies on domestic bioenergy crop production would lead to higher regional food and feed prices, as well as increased land prices in a land-constrained economy."}

Seismic sections have shown the presence of mud diapirs, gas-filled zones, and faults that connect these zones to the seafloor, which are conducive to hydrate generation. Using a thermodynamic method, researchers have determined the distribution of gas hydrate stable zones and predicted potential locations of gas hydrate near the seafloor. Biogenic methane hydrate and thermogenic gas hydrate have a total prospective volume of approximately 10x10^9m^3 with a hydrate gas volume of around 1.6x10^12m^3. Gas hydrate is a potential future energy resource, but its dissociation could contribute to global warming and seabed instability."}

SO2 emissions fell from 3185 Gg S in 1970 to 344 Gg S in 2005 and are predicted to fall to 172 Gg by 2020. NOx emissions also decreased from 951 Gg N in 1970 to 378 by 2005, with a further decrease to 243 Gg N forecast by 2020. However, reductions in NH3 emissions have not been as significant. The study also found that the deposition of nitrogen and sulphur decreased more slowly than the emissions reduction rate due to factors such as increased emissions from international shipping and changing rates of atmospheric oxidation. The study suggests that future policies will need to focus on controlling emissions from international shipping and agriculture to achieve further reductions."}

The study found that the total irrigated area remained largely unchanged over the decade, while the built-up area within the watershed boundaries doubled. There was also a shift in cropping patterns from paddy rice to paragrass and leafy vegetables, due to increased profitability from high urban demand. The study concluded that the opportunistic use of wastewater and irrigation practices will continue to meet the livelihood needs of the poor, driven by market demands, as urban sprawl expands."}

The study, which took place 2-6 years after the treatments, found that thinning operations altered soil variables and greatly reduced organic matter content. The research also found a significant correlation between microbiological and biochemical variables and physical chemical variables, organic matter, and total nitrogen. The results suggest that adaptive management forest plans should consider these findings to achieve sustainable forest management, particularly in Mediterranean forests prone to wildfire disturbances."}

The research found that participants had difficulty understanding the information and expressed attitudes of fear, skepticism, and fatalism. The study also found that SLR risks were perceived as distant, both in time and space, which poses a challenge for communicators trying to convey a sense of urgency. The authors suggest that risk messages need to be framed appropriately, visually compelling, and take into account diverse viewpoints to be comprehensible and persuasive."}

A study used GIS techniques and DRASTIC models to assess the vulnerability of the groundwater. The results showed that areas with \"moderately high\" to \"high\" vulnerability are along the coastline where saltwater intrusion is common. The \"low\" vulnerability category is limited to a small area in the northwest. The study also found a significant association between high groundwater nitrate concentrations and distances from certain land use types, including farms, orchards, industrial complexes, and residential buildings."}

The model estimated the potential economic impacts of constructing and operating biorefineries using three different technology pathways: cellulosic ethanol in Iowa, renewable diesel in Georgia, and renewable diesel and gasoline via fast pyrolysis in Mississippi. The construction of a biorefinery processing 2000 dry metric tons of biomass per day could create between 5960 and 8470 full-time jobs, with fast pyrolysis biorefineries producing the most jobs due to the highest capital requirement. The operation of a biorefinery could support between 720 and 970 jobs annually. The agriculture/forest, services, and trade industries are expected to benefit the most from the operation of biorefineries."}

The research combined 22 years of crop statistics with harvest indices and land use to calculate stubble productivity. The study focused on areas where stubble concentrations within a 50 km radius were at least 500 kt per year, the amount suggested for a viable lignocellulosic bioethanol facility. The study revealed, for the first time, where large amounts of stubble are located in Australia. Future work will determine if the supply of stubble is consistently available and economically viable for a biofuel plant."}
