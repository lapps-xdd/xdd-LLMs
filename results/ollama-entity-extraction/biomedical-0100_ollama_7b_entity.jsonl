Information processing models of attention - Hypothesis\n17. P300 peak latency - Measurement\n18. Initially reported to be about 300 ms (Sutton, Tueting, Zubin, & John, 1967) - Citation\n19. Support for this hypothesis can be found in increased latency when stimulus discriminability is reduced (McCarthy & Donchin, 1981), to increases in stimulus complexity (McCallum, 1980), and to increased improbability of feedback stimulus (Cambell, Courchesne, Picton, & Squires, 1979) - Citation\n20. Posner, Klein, Summers, and Buggie (1973) reported that P3 latency was longer in the mismatch condition of a two-stimulus paradigm than in a match condition. For words, the difference was 100 ms. - Citation\n21. Inspection of the grand average waveforms obtained in a comparative judgement task (Sanquist, Rohrbaugh, Syndulko, & Lindsley, 1980) to the second of a pair of sequentially presented words differing on orthographic or phonemic, but not semantic, criteria revealed that P300 peak latency was later in mismatch than in match conditions. - Citation\n22. Increased latency has also been demonstrated to the more improbable event in a letter matching task, independent of any delay due to mismatch stimuli (Duncan-Johnson & Donchin, 1982) and with increasing difficulty of semantic categorization under conditions stressing accuracy (Kutas, McCarthy, & Donchin, 1977). - Citation\n23. However, as noted by Hansen and Hillyard (1983), targets are typically presented less frequently than standards and may elicit increased ERP components because their neural generators are in a less \u201crefractory\u201d state. - Citation\n24. Sutton, Ruchkin, Munson, Kietzman, and Hammer (1982) investigated the P300 using principle component analysis with varimax rotation (PCA) in a two-interval, forced-choice paradigm. Basic to the experiment was the hypothesis that \u201cthe P300 component is sensitive to the event in the trial from which the response was made.\u201d - Citation\n\nNote: The types are based on the JSON notation and are represented as follows:\n\n* Magazine: \"International Journal of Neuroscience\"\n* Address: \"Kraepelinstr. 10, 8000 Munich 40, FRG\"\n* Date: \"Received July 7, 198s\"\n* Hypothesis: \"information processing models of attention\"\n* Citation: \"Sutton, Ruchkin, Munson, Kietzman, and Hammer (1982) investigated the P300 using principle component analysis with varimax rotation (PCA) in a two-interval, forced-choice paradigm.
