These opal beds are interpreted to have been precipitated from an advecting, high-temperature geothermal fluid that flowed through bedrock and/or from a deep-crustal source. The Sr/Sr values of the opal beds (0.71301 to 0.71724) are consistent with precipitation from this fluid.\n\n{calcite beds: type: chemically precipitated sedimentary rock}\n\nThe text also describes four beds of calcite that are locally replaced by opal glaebules and then to microcrystalline calcite. The carbon and oxygen isotopic values of the calcite beds (dCPDB = 27.1 to 20.6; dOPDB = 29.1 to 25.6) lie between and overlap those of Paleozoic carbonate and Pliocene paleosol calcite, suggesting precipitation from a mixture of a high-temperature geothermal fluid that interacted with Paleozoic carbonates and shallow, meteoric groundwater.\n\n{limestones, evaporites, diatomites: type: chemically precipitated sedimentary rock}\n\nThe text mentions that syn-rift strata may also contain localized chemically precipitated sedimentary rocks, including limestones, evaporites, and diatomites deposited in lakes and wetlands. These rocks are thought to have been deposited in response to changes in the water table and/or temperature.\n\n{tufas and travertines: type: chemically precipitated sedimentary rock}\n\nThe text also mentions that syn-rift strata may contain siliceous sinters associated with cold or hot springs, which are thought to have been deposited in response to chemical reactions between groundwater and minerals.\n\n{calcite and iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides: type: chemically precipitated sedimentary rock}\n\nThe text notes that calcite and iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides may be precipitated in subsurface horizons of soils, which are thought to have been deposited in response to changes in the water table and/or temperature.\n\n{authigenic calcite: type: chemically precipitated sedimentary rock}\n\nThe text mentions that authigenic calcite may be precipitated from shallow, meteoric groundwater, which is thought to have been deposited in response to changes in the water table and/or temperature."}

Within these zones, there are different types of slabs, including flat-slab subduction zones, which are characterized by a horizontal or little variation in terms of slab geometry. The text also mentions trench roll-back and the structure of oceanic and overriding plates as important factors that facilitate slab flattening in these zones.

The solution is derived from an existing closed-form analytical solution for determining groundwater travel time when the recharge of the aquifer is known. The new solution uses anthropogenic atmospheric gas measurements to determine differences in groundwater residence time between two water samples, and enters these time differences into the new analytical solution to determine recharge.\n\nThe text also presents a sensitivity analysis of the new analytical solution to quantify the influence of different parameters that control recharge: hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, and groundwater travel time. The study illustrates how geochemical data can be combined with physical models to measure recharge, and suggests that such an approach could be adopted in other homogeneous aquifers worldwide that satisfy Dupuit-Forchheimer type flow conditions.\n\nOverall, the text provides a detailed description of the new analytical solution and its application to the Bonifacio aquifer in Corsica, France."}
