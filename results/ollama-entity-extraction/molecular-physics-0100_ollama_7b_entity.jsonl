BAFILE, F. BAROCCHI, F. CILLOCO & R. MAGLI (1998) Neutron diffraction from low-density CD4 gas - Entity: Article citation - Type: Citation\n8. It has been shown that neturon di raction experiments in low-density gases can provide valuable information on two- [1] and three-body [2] potentials in monatomic systems with closed electronic shells. - Entity: Scientific statement - Type: Scientific claim\n9. To this aim, the low-density behaviour of the structure factor S (Q ) is determined in either conventional or small-angle scattering experiments [3], and the pair and triplet contributions to S (Q ) are then extracted by means of a kind of virial expansion applied to a Q - dependent property. - Entity: Scientific procedure - Type: Experimental technique\n10. The S (Q ) virial expansion is related directly to the virial expansion of the pair correlation function g( r ) , which in turn is related to the pair and triplet interaction potentials. - Entity: Scientific relationship - Type: Mathematical relationship\n11. In principle the previous methods can be applied to the study of the intermolecular structure of any kind of molecular gas. However, with a polyatomic system several complications arise when the total scattered intensity is measured and analysed. - Entity: Scientific statement - Type: Scientific claim\n12. First, at low densities the Q behaviour of the neutron di raction cross-section is dominated strongly by the intramolecular contribution, and the interesting portion of the signal, related to the centre-of-mass correlation, appears as a small modulation of the total intensity. - Entity: Scientific statement - Type: Scientific claim\n13. Second, the e ect of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom on the scattered intensity largely complicates the data analysis, making necessary the introduction of approximations for the decoupling of translational, rotational, and vibrational motions, and making the inelasticity correction more di cult. - Entity: Scientific statement - Type: Scientific claim\n14. Moreover, since in general in molecular systems the interaction potential is anisotropic, the measured structure factor re\u00af ects the properties of the pair distribution function, which depends on both the centre-of-mass distance and the angular coordinates of the molecular pair, while the centre-of-mass S (Q ) is related only to the radial distribution function obtained by integrating over the angular variables. - Entity: Scientific statement - Type: Scientific claim\n15. Here we report the experimental results and the density analysis of neutron di raction measurements on dilute gaseous CD4 performed in order to study the pair, and possibly triplet, contributions to the centreof-mass S (Q ) . - Entity: Experiment - Type: Scientific experiment\n16. CD4 has been chosen for this \u00ae rst experiment in a polyatomic system because of the almost spherical symmetry of this molecule and the consequent small anisotropy of the pair interaction potential, and because it has a relatively large coherent scattering cross-section and a negligible neutron absorption cross-section. - Entity: Experiment - Type: Scientific experiment\n17. Section 2 summarizes the relevant expressions for the analysis of neutron scattering from molecular systems. - Entity: Section - Type: Text section\n18. Section 3 reports the generalities of the [/Entity: Section - Type: Text section"}

I - Type: Text\n10. a general evolution equation for the distribution function of a system in contact with a reservoir was derived - Type: Claim\n11. this equation has the structure of the Liouville equation except that the modified Liouville operator ~ is now not self-adjoint due to the system-reservoir interactions - Type: Claim\n12. the modified Liouville operator ~q~was the sum of two parts ~ o and A~L#t where As was the ratio of the masses of the heavy and light particles - Type: Claim\n13. ~o was a function of the system phase 17 but only operated on the bath subset I~b of the system phase - Type: Claim\n14. a kinetic equation for the distribution function for the sub-system (heavy particle) phase rs= F-l~b was derived - Type: Claim\n15. with plausible assumptions it was then possible to develop this equation as a power series in A and show that the terms did not diverge with time - Type: Claim\n16. Choosing the local equilibrium distribution function as an initial condition, linearizing in the temperature gradient and retaining terms through second order in the coupling parameters do not diverge with time - Type: Claim\n17.

Istituto di Fisica Sperimentale dell'Universit\u00e0 di Napoli, Napoli, Italy - Type: Institution\n13. Received 1 November 1965; revision received 14 January 1966 - Type: Publication metadata\n14. Glycogen, which, as is well known, is a polysaccharide, has a sphero-macromolecular structure with a great deal of ramifications, as shown at first by Staudinger and Husemann [2] and successively confirmed by other researches. - Type: Description\n15. The measurements carried out by us show that glycogen dissolved in water with low concentrations decreases remarkably the thermal relaxation time. - Type: Statement\n16. The measured values of T1 are much shorter than those for water-glycerin mixtures having the same viscosity (figure 1). - Type: Comparison\n17. This result can be easily understood if one considers the fact that in disperse systems of macromolecular substances the correlation times, and therefore the relaxation times, are not affected by the 'macroviscosity' ~/; namely by the viscosity which can be really measured and arises from the particular structure of the macromolecular substance involved. - Type: Explanation\n18. To explain the behaviour of 7'1 in these systems other factors, such as type and degree of solvation and 'microviscosity', are to be considered. - Type: Additional information\n19. The measurements performed show also that for glycogen in water the variation law of T1-1 with the concentration c may be considered linear: T1-1 = Tlw-1 +k . c, Tlw being the thermal relaxation time of distilled water (figure 2). - Type: Statement\n20. This result is analogous to that obtained by Daszkiewicz et al. in aqueous solutions of ovalbumin [3] which is a sphero-protein. - Type: Comparison\n21. However, the value of the k constant, calculated for ovalbumin, is remarkably lower than for glycogen (0-03 instead of 0.08, if one expresses the reciprocal of T1 in sec-1 and c in g of solute in 100 g of solution). - Type: Comparison\n22. This may be due to a lower hydration of ovalbumin and to a different structure of ovalbumin and glycogen. - Type: Explanation\n23. The ovalbumin sphero-macromolecules are not branched but are probably compact and do not occlude solvent molecules. - Type: Description\n24. On the contrary, glycogen macromolecules mechanically hold many water molecules [4]. - Type: Description"}

To cite this article: L. Campbell & M.J. Brunger (2016)\n\t* Type: Citation information\n5. 1. Introduction: Free electrons in atmospheres arise from many sources, including photoionisation, solar and magnetospheric particles, cosmic rays, meteoroids and electrical potentials.\n\t* Type: Research article introduction\n6. Depending on their energy, the primary electrons can produce ionisation and dissociation of neutral atmospheric species and a cascade of secondary electrons, which in turn can produce further ionisation, dissociation, excitation and heating.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n7. As the secondary electrons move to lower energies they can also take part in deexcitation, recombination with ions and attachment to produce negative ions or dissociation.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n8. Excited product species can radiatively decay, producing or contributing to phenomena such as dayglow and nightglow, aurora, meteor trails, lightning and sprites.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n9. Together with the ions produced in the initial ionisation, the ions and excited atoms and molecules produced by electron impact may allow or enhance chemical reactions, modifying the chemical composition of the atmosphere.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n10. The trace components produced contribute to the radiative properties of atmospheres, which determine temperature and possibly climate.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n11. For example, there are several theories of a \u2018sun-climate\u2019 correlation which involve electron processes in their explanation [1].\n\t* Type: Scientific reference\n12. Quantitative understanding of these processes is necessary to understand the composition and behaviour of atmospheres.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n13. It is also necessary in order to interpret remote sensing of emissions produced by electron processes, which is a major tool for measuring atmospheric parameters.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n14. Both require numerical modelling of the electron-impact processes and subsequent chemical reactions.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n15. The modelling requires accurate cross sections for electron impact processes and accurate reaction rates for the subsequent chemical reactions involving the excited or reactive products.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n16. In cases where these are relatively long-lived, they can be transported vertically by molecular, ambipolar or eddy diffusion and react at a different height to where they are produced, so a one-dimensional (1-D) model is usually required to implement useful simulations by calculating at a number of different heights and incorporating the vertical transport of the products between different heights.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n17. Plasma processes cover an extreme range of densities, from the interstellar medium to the plasma at the centre of stars.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n18. It is often desirable to use measurements in laboratory plasmas, which lie at the centre of this range, to provide data for processes at the extremes.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n19. Laboratory plasmas sit in the middle of the subrange from upper planetary atmospheres to atmospheric-pressure plasmas.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n20. Thus it is desirable to be able to perform plasma simulations across this range, so that both can make use of laboratory data.\n\t* Type: Scientific statement\n\nEntities and their types:\n\n1.
