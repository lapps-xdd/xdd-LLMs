These beds are interpreted to have been precipitated from a geothermal fluid that flowed through the bedrock and/or from a deep-crustal source. The fluid is thought to have upwelled along the East Rincon Hills fault and flowed laterally at or just below the surface, resulting in the precipitation of opal in response to rapid cooling and evaporation. The text also notes that chemically precipitated sedimentary rocks, such as limestones, evaporites, and diatomites, are common in terrestrial continental-rift basins, but may provide important information about basin-scale depositional architecture, paleoclimate, and groundwater composition and flow paths. The text references previous studies that have mapped Pliocene-lower Pleistocene strata of the Camp Rice Formation in the area, which contain opal beds that are laterally equivalent to white, fine-grained beds of calcite."}

They find that while phytoplankton productivity increases along the phosphorus gradient, whole-lake benthic algal productivity decreases, leading to a shift from benthic to pelagic dominance of primary production. Periphyton is responsible for most of the primary production in shallow, oligotrophic lakes, while phytoplankton are responsible for nearly all primary production in Danish lakes with higher phosphorus concentrations. The study suggests that eutrophication leads to a redistribution of primary production from benthic to pelagic habitats, and that both habitats are energetically linked through food web interactions. However, the long-term effects of eutrophication on these ecosystems remain a concern."}

These regions exhibit flat-slab subduction, where the oceanic lithosphere sinks horizontally into the mantle before diving down at a shallower angle. The study finds that certain parameters facilitate slab flattening in these zones, including trench roll-back and variations in the structure of the oceanic and overriding plates. However, the authors were unable to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the formation of flat slabs in all three subduction zones. They suggest that a numerical approach considering the influence of surrounding plates and their geometries on 3D subduction dynamics may be necessary to fully understand the origin of flat-slab subduction."}

The study focuses on four timeslice scenarios (1960, 1980, 1990, and 2015) and finds that changes in the NAO index have a significant impact on stratospheric dynamics and ozone evolution. Specifically, the study shows that:\n\n* In the positive phase of the NAO, the stratospheric polar vortex is stronger and colder than in the negative phase.\n* In the troposphere, the positive phase is marked by increased variance across the North Atlantic stormtrack, while the negative phase suggests blocking.\n* Vertical stationary wave propagation is reduced in the positive phase.\n* The model NAO index decreases significantly from 1990 to 2015.\n\nThese changes are found to coincide with enhanced vertical stationary wave propagation and a dynamical heating of the northern polar stratosphere, which could influence stratospheric dynamics and ozone recovery.

The model takes into account the effects of snow grain size, impurities, black carbon, and mineral dust on albedo and solar heating. PBSAM calculates albedos by dividing each broadband spectrum into several spectral subbands to simulate changes in the spectral distribution of solar radiation at the snow surface and in the snowpack. The model uses a combination of look-up table methods, adding methods, and spectral weighting to calculate albedo and transmittance in spectral subbands for a homogeneous snow layer. The accuracy of PBSAM was confirmed by comparing its calculations with those of a spectrally detailed radiative transfer model (RTM) using radiation budget measurements and snow pit data from Sapporo, Japan. The model was able to accurately simulate broadband albedos of single- and two-layer snow models with good accuracy."}

The study suggests that this phenomenon is caused by a combination of dynamical, microphysical, and related feedback mechanisms.

However, deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high, leading to significant carbon emissions. In this study, the authors quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types in the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangroves. They found that the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in the Dominican Republic had carbon stocks ranging from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha, with medium-statured mangroves having the highest carbon storage. The authors also found that the low mangrove (shrub) type had relatively high carbon stocks due to the presence of carbon-rich soils up to 2 m deep. The conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds resulted in estimated emissions ranging from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO2e/ha, which is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The authors estimate that the 6260 ha of mangroves and converted lands in the Montecristi Province contain 3841490 Mg of C, with mangroves representing 76% of this area but currently storing 97% of the carbon. Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C, while comprising 24% of the area. The authors conclude that the inclusion of mangroves in climate-change mitigation strategies is warranted due to their high carbon stocks and the significant emissions resulting from their conversion."}

The hydrographs are grouped into four types: rising, falling, peaked-falling, and peaked hydrographs. Peaked hydrographs are further divided based on the magnitude of their bulk flow, baseflow, and diurnal flow components. The study finds that runoff cycles evolve systematically during the melt season in response to the removal of the seasonal snowpack from the ablation area. Peaked hydrographs predominate after the onset of snowpack removal, with an increasing and progressively earlier diurnal peak, but also a low baseflow component likely due to surface melt contributing directly to subglacial channels. The study concludes that runoff cycle evolution has significant geomorphic implications, as peaked surface runoff cycles result in the formation of hydraulically efficient subglacial drainage and a significant increase in the gradient of the relationship between suspended sediment transport and discharge. Increasingly peaked diurnal cycles also lead to increased basal sediment availability, likely due to high diurnal water pressure variation within subglacial channels, which may enhance rates of basal sliding and subglacial erosion. The study highlights the potential influence of runoff cycle form and evolution on glacial erosion rates and sediment yields."}

The analysis revealed two important fluxes that transport elements to the equatorial Pacific seafloor: (1) a high biogenic source associated with equatorial divergence of surface water and upwelling of nutrient-rich water, and (2) a high aluminosilicate flux at 4\u00b0N, associated with increased terrigenous input from elevated rainfall at the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) of the tradewinds. The study found that trace elements such as Cr, As, Pb, and rare earth elements (REEs) are also influenced by the biogenic flux at the Equator, although this association is not regionally dominant. Additionally, the high tenigenous flux at the ITCZ has a profound effect on chemical transport to the seafloor, with elemental fluxes increasing tremendously and in parallel with Ti. The study also found that many other elements (including Mn, Pb, As, and REEs) record greater accumulation beneath the ITCZ than at the Equator, suggesting that adsorptive scavenging by terrigenous particulate matter or phases intimately associated with them is an important process regulating elemental transport to the equatorial Pacific seafloor. The findings emphasize the role of vertical transport to the sediment and provide additional constraints on the paleochemical use of trace elements to track biogenic and terrigenous fluxes."}

The results show that many atoll islands are expected to have a measurable freshwater lens during the majority of a long-term climatic period, but significant decreases in thickness can occur during the dry season. The study also found a general decrease in lens thickness of approximately 2-4 cm/yr over 14 years for the northern regions of the Maldives.

The results show that crocodilians and dinosaurs have different d18OPO4 values, with crocodilians having lower values consistent with a latitudinal distribution between ectotherms and endotherms. Additionally, the d18OH2O value for dinosaurs is higher than for crocodilians, indicating that semiaquatic ectothermic taxa represent local meteoric waters in a brief window of time when conditions are favorable for apatite synthesis. The study also found that the mean air temperature calculated using d18OH2O values shows an increase between G1 and G2, which may be related to differences in the sedimentological setting or a shift towards warmer conditions over time. Finally, the sauropod d13C value is within the predicted range for C3 vegetation.

The main coastal mountain range separates regions with different cloud regimes: stratocumulus-topped boundary layer convection near the coast and continental cumulus convection further inland. A regional climate model simulation was used to explain the observed variability, which is linked to thermal circulations generated by the land-sea contrast and orography. The extent of cloud penetration into inland areas is related to the size of the coastal mountains, with smaller hills enhancing cloudiness and larger mountains blocking the marine boundary layer further inland. The warming due to subsidence at night helps evaporate clouds, which is consistent with potential temperature budget analysis. Stratocumulus decks are frequent in summer over western subtropical continents, including the Iberian Peninsula, due to a combination of synoptic and regional circulations. These conditions increase low tropospheric stability and estimated inversion strength, which are well correlated with low cloud cover. The study highlights the importance of considering the diurnal cycle of clouds in numerical weather prediction and climate models, as it is linked to the amount of low clouds and the base of many schemes."}

The surface debris thickens and transitions from convex-up to concave-down along the glacier. This pattern is explained using a combination of theoretical models and empirical observations. The down-glacier thickening of debris is due to the conveyor-belt-like nature of the glacier surface in the ablation zone, where debris can only be added but not removed, and the decline in ice surface velocity towards the terminus. This leads to a reduction in sub-debris melt and debris emergence towards the terminus. Convex-up debris thickness patterns occur near the up-glacier end of debris covers where debris emergence dominates, while concave-up debris thickness patterns occur towards the glacier termini where declining surface velocities dominate. The article highlights that deviations from this longitudinal shape are likely caused by changes in hillslope debris supply over time, and that understanding these patterns can help identify the effects of climate change on debris cover."}

The results showed that the temperature variation of both thermistors increased as the temperature and pressure were decreased. The observed behavior was explained using heat-transfer equations.

This review focuses on three main areas: combining field surveys and remote sensing, evaluating biodiversity and carbon values under a unified strategy, and research efforts needed to understand and quantify forest degradation and recovery. Improving monitoring strategies will help reduce uncertainties in models of the key processes in the carbon cycle, including their impacts on biodiversity, which are fundamental to support forest governance policies such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.\n\nKeywords: carbon emissions, ecosystem modeling, field inventories, forest dynamics, remote sensing."}

The study uses field observations, engineering and fluid dynamic models, and calculations of wave motion to predict the potential damage to corals. The findings suggest that massive corals in shallow lagoons will survive but tabular corals on the reef crest and slope will be severely impacted. This implies that super-extreme typhoons will cause a loss of species diversity, which is critical for maintaining reef ecosystems. The study highlights the importance of reef restoration in the wake of such events to maintain reef ecosystems."}

The study combines orbital-scale records with model simulations to reconstruct precipitation d2H variability in the region. The authors argue that using leaf waxes as a proxy reduces variability derived from different vegetation or microclimates and has a short residence time in monsoonal river catchments. The study finds that the apparent fractionation between dHp and n-alkane d2H ranges from -130\u2030 to -140\u2030 along a transect from 18\u00b0N to 50\u00b0N, which is similar to the range found in sites analogous to the Pearl River catchment.

To investigate the effects of commercial Bt products on two common marine bivalves, Mytilaster minimus and Brachidontes pharaonis, the authors simulated worst-case scenarios using average dose applied to fields and hypothetical accumulation doses. The results showed that both species had detrimental effects on their feeding rates, respiration rates, and energy budgets with higher concentrations of Bt. The study also found significant mortality in the worst treatments and increased cardiac activity in both species compared to controls. These findings suggest that commercial Bt products have a measurable effect on marine organisms and highlight the need for further research on the impact of biopesticides on non-target organisms, particularly in coastal ecosystems."}

The cores were used to assess the completeness of the stratigraphic record and how it was influenced by faulting and climate change. The study found that a N-S trending fault system downdropped the eastern block of the Salar de Atacama relative to the western block, with major faulting occurring between 16.5 and 5.4 ka. Aggradation of efflorescent halite crusts on the downdropped eastern block helped to smooth out topographic variations created by faulting. The study also found that the stratigraphic record was temporally complete, with sedimentation rates ranging from 0.6-0.9 m/kyr and 0.3-3.6 m/kyr on the 10 kyr and longer scales, respectively. These findings suggest that paleoclimate records obtained from the cores are representative of basin-wide climate change and can be used for regional paleoclimate reconstructions."}

The study used future climate projections generated specifically for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest using a statistical technique that downscaled climate output from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) to a finer temporal and spatial resolution. The results showed that under future climate change, average air temperature is expected to increase by 1.7-6.5\u00b0C, with simultaneous increases in annual average precipitation ranging from 4-32 cm above the long-term mean (1970-2000). The model simulations under future climate change showed a shift in hydrology characterized by later snowpack development, earlier spring discharge (snowmelt), greater evapotranspiration, and a slight increase in annual water yield associated with CO2 effects on vegetation. The study also found that under elevated temperature, net soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification markedly increase, resulting in acidification of soil and stream water, which can alter the quality of water draining from forested watersheds. Overall, the study highlights the need for a more thorough understanding of CO2 effects on forest vegetation to mitigate watershed nitrogen loss under future climate change."}

The models differ in their ocean vertical mixing parameterizations and configurations. While some models include effects of surface waves, Langmuir circulations, submesoscale eddies, and additional wind mixing to improve upper-ocean simulation, most of the models underestimate the MLD compared to observations. The study suggests that insufficient vertical mixing in the upper ocean may be a potential reason for this systematic underestimation. The surface mixed layer is an important variable in the global climate system as it affects heat, momentum, and energy exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere. Climate models generally underestimate the summer MLD, while some models overestimate the winter MLD. One possible cause for the underestimated summer MLD is the insufficient vertical mixing in the upper ocean."}

A total of 27 crab morphospecies were recorded, with eleven being new to the Cameroon coastline. Sesarmid crabs were the most represented species (10), followed by Hill evenness close to 1, indicating that one species (Guinearma kamermani) tends to dominate the community. The Center mangrove stands had the most diverse species composition (E(Sn=401) = 18 \u00b1 1.1 species), followed by the South (E(Sn=401) = 16 \u00b1 0.5 species) and North (E(Sn=401) = 11 \u00b1 0.0 species).

The WL and SW treatments lasted for 5 days, while the ST treatment was continuously imposed during the grain filling stage. The study found that ST and SW treatments significantly decreased net photosynthetic rate (PN) of the flag leaf, which could be attributed to stomatal closure. At 18 DAA, a clear reduction in PN under the ST and SW treatments was observed, which was associated with chlorosis, damages to the photosystem II (PSII), enhanced lipid peroxidation, and depressed ATP synthesis in the chloroplasts of the flag leaf. In contrast, WL treatment alone had a slightly negative effect on PN, which was mainly attributed to leaf chlorosis and waste in harvested energy by the PSII reaction center dispersed via non-photochemical approaches."}

The MJO shows a prominent interannual variability with periods of 2-8 years and 12-16 years, which are closely related to the intensity and duration of strong discrete MJO events. During strong MJO activity winter, the MJO is intensified throughout the tropics and its eastward propagation is more continuous, coherent, and further east. The moistening at the lower troposphere to the east of the MJO convection center is dominated by vertical advection of moisture, which enhances the Walker circulation over the equatorial Pacific and favors MJO activity over the equatorial western Pacific.

Bush proposed increasing research and development for technology to capture, store, and sequester greenhouse gases (GHGs) due to concerns about rising GHG concentrations, particularly carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. Although the Bush administration and Congress have been hesitant to establish a direct link between GHG levels and climate change, some entities, including industry representatives, have already implemented projects that have reduced millions of tons of GHG emissions. These actions will slow the effects of future climate change, but more action is needed to reverse or make them negligible. Sequestration activities can be carried out by industry at minimal cost and with greater ease than some believe. Climate change is often used as a synonym for global warming, but it refers to variations in climate patterns across the globe, including temperature increases and decreases. The greenhouse effect, caused by the atmosphere's composition, traps heat reflected by the Earth's surface and sends it back towards the Earth, increasing the average global temperature by 60\u00b0F. An increased GHG concentration affects the atmosphere's composition, causing it to reradiate more heat back towards the Earth's surface, leading to a global increase in temperature. Global warming theory was first proposed in 1896, and as consumption of fossil fuels and industrial production increased, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 began to correlate with a global temperature increase. The international community addressed GHGs and convened the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which began reporting in 1995 that there is a discernible human influence on global climate. Some specific effects of climate change include warmer summers, colder winters, more extreme weather events, wild fluctuations in precipitation, increased desertification, and species shifts."}

The results indicate that most intrageneric divisions within Ascarina and Hedyosmum are not monophyletic, and suggest that the Hedyosmum-like fossil Asteropollis represents a stem lineage of Hedyosmum. In contrast, the study suggests that the Chloranthus-like fossil Chloranthistemon may instead belong to the branch leading to the clade Chloranthus + Sarcandra. The median crown ages of Chloranthus, Sarcandra, Ascarina, and Hedyosmum were estimated to be 26.3, 9.5, 31.0, and 45.8 million years ago, respectively. The study highlights the importance of using molecular dating analyses to explore alternative phylogenetic placements of fossil taxa and sheds further light on the temporal evolution of Chloranthaceae."}

This action may lead to changes in sedimentation across reef sites. To provide management advice, the study quantified proximate environmental factors influencing scleractinian coral cover and community patterns at Palmyra. The proportion of fine sedimentation was the optimal predictor of coral cover and changes in community structure, explaining 23.7% and 24.7% of the variation between sites, respectively. Scleractinian coral cover was negatively correlated with increases in fine sedimentation. Removing the causeway may harm Montipora corals dominating the western reef terrace, as this genus was negatively correlated with levels of fine sedimentation. Before complete removal of the causeway, it is essential to determine the tolerance limits of corals and sediment redistribution patterns."}

The researchers sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNA control region in 295 individuals from 22 populations across Central Europe and identified 51 distinct haplotypes with a maximum distance of 5.6% between them. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two main clades: an 'Italian' clade and an 'Alpine' clade, with two hybrid zones located in the Mediterranean Alps and the Soca basin. The study also suggests that L. turskyi, the sister species of L. souffia, represents a third lineage that originated at the same time as the 'Alpine' and 'Italian' clades. The 'Alpine' clade is further divided into two subclades: one with haplotypes from the Rh\u00f4ne and Var basins, and another with haplotypes from the Danube and Rhine systems. The study suggests that the vairone has a long history in Central Europe predating Pleistocene glacial cycles, with two main refugia during glaciations located in Italy and the Danube system. However, age estimates based on molecular clock calibrations suggest that 'Alpine' haplotypes survived in several drainages during the last glaciation cycles, with the Rhine system being recently colonized."}

Expanding the range of MPAs to include degraded reefs (DR-MPA) could help reverse this trend. This approach requires new ecological criteria for MPA design, siting, and management, focusing on the potential for biodiversity recovery and renewal of ecosystem services. The new criteria would identify sites with the highest potential for recovery and greatest resistance to future threats, such as increased temperature and acidification, and sites that contribute to MPA connectivity. This approach complements traditional MPA design approaches rather than replacing them. It can enhance the natural or restoration-assisted recovery of degraded reefs, increase total reef area available for protection, promote more resilient and better-connected MPAs networks, and improve conditions for human communities dependent on MPA ecosystem services. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change, threaten coral reef biodiversity, ecological functioning, and ecosystem services. While protection of functioning reefs can enhance recovery following wide-scale natural disturbances, the continuing large-scale degradation of coral reefs has reduced the availability of healthy reefs for MPA designation, making it difficult to find 10% of reefs in good condition in many regions. The Convention on Biological Diversity recommends conserving at least 10% of each ecological region by 2010, but the impact of this protection depends on the state of protected sites, and in many regions, it may be difficult to find 10% of reefs in good condition."}

The researchers used seismic and core evidence, as well as 3-dimensional numerical modeling, to identify the delta's initial development around 65 thousand years ago during a global sea level lowstand, and its termination around 56 thousand years ago during a sea level highstand. The analysis of the delta's internal architecture revealed that it was primarily fed by an offshore transport pathway from the southwestern Hainan Island. To uncover the driving mechanisms behind the delta's formation, the researchers used numerical modeling to simulate oceanographic and morphodynamic scenarios during the initial delta development. The results suggest that sediment dynamics in the study area are controlled by a complex interplay of monsoon-driven circulation, river plumes, tides, and typhoons. While the Red River contributes less to the delta's formation compared to local rivers in SW Hainan due to the combined effect of regional circulation and tides, which causes a detour of the buoyancy-driven plume around the delta, the study reveals that there was at least ten times higher sediment supply rate from SW Hainan during the developing phase of the river delta than the modern condition."}

The article presents a field case example for the Bonifacio aquifer in Corsica (France) using anthropogenic atmospheric gas measurements to establish differences in groundwater residence time between two water samples. The time difference is entered into the new analytical solution to determine recharge, which yields a value that agrees with results obtained by other methods.

The steepening of the water level curve with SLR leads to a reduction in fullness, but the changes in overflow volumes also depend on the magnitude of the storm surge event.

The authors update the ED2 model to include a dynamic feedback between these factors and validate it against observations across different time scales and regions. They find that the updated model accurately reproduces observations when a dynamic soil organic layer is included. Simulations indicate that a thick soil organic layer after a mild fire disturbance can decrease decomposition and productivity, leading to increased carbon storage. However, with a 48\u00b0C temperature increase, some forests may transition from undergoing succession to recruiting multiple cohorts of broadleaf trees, resulting in decreased total ecosystem carbon. Nitrogen availability also regulates successional dynamics, with broadleaf species being less competitive with needleleaf trees under low nitrogen regimes. Finally, the boreal forest shows additional short-term capacity for carbon sequestration as atmospheric CO2 increases.

A paired plot experiment was conducted to investigate the impacts of simulated warming on soil freezing and thawing processes and soybean production. The results showed that artificial warming shortened the duration of soil freezing and thawing by 39 days, resulting in a significant reduction in the maximum frost depth. However, the warming did not significantly affect the average annual freeze-thaw cycle frequency. During the dry year of 2015, warming did not significantly affect surface soil moisture during the period from sowing to the soybean cotyledon stage. Therefore, the increased soil temperature due to warming may have positively affected soybean growth and production. In contrast, in the wet year of 2014, warming decreased surface soil moisture from sowing to the soybean VC (cotyledon) stage, which may have offset the positive effects of increased soil temperature on soybean yield.

The study found that:\n\n* Capital investment associated with the construction of a biorefinery processing 2000 dry metric tons of biomass per day (DMT/day) could yield between 5960 and 8470 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs during the construction period.\n* Fast pyrolysis biorefineries produce the most jobs on a project level, with normalized job numbers of 12.1 jobs per $1 million of capital investment.\n* The agriculture/forest, services, and trade industries are the primary sectors that will benefit from the ongoing operation of biorefineries.\n* Indirect effects stimulated by the operation of biorefineries are the primary contributor to job growth.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that the development of a cellulosic biofuel industry in the US has the potential to create significant economic opportunities and job growth, particularly in rural areas where biomass resources are abundant."}

The research focused on areas where the stubble concentrations within a 50 km radius were at least 500 kt per year, which is the amount suggested for a viable lignocellolosic bioethanol facility. The study found that there are large amounts of stubble in Australia, but whether the supply of stubble is sufficiently constant over time and available at a price that is economic for a biofuel plant must be subject to future work. The research highlights the potential of biomass for energy conversion, with estimates suggesting that it could contribute 23% to the world's energy production by 2050. However, the feasibility of realizing this potential depends on various issues, including the availability of significant quantities of feedstock at a competitive price."}
