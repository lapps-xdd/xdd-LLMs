The DCFs are used to predict hydration free energies of 504 small organic molecules, resulting in an average unsigned error of 0.66 kcal/mol compared to simulation data. The DCFs reflect the variational of the local chemical potential of individual atoms/interaction sites with density-profile fluctuations, which are difficult to be sampled from the simulation trajectory. The article demonstrates the importance of DCFs in modern liquid-state theories and their non-mean-field implementation of classical density functional theory (cDFT)."}

The available sedimentary record includes subaerial and perennially frozen sediments, as well as lacustrine and fluvial formations. Geochronometric measurements using radiocarbon and luminescence techniques have placed this record within a time span of 50,000 to 11,000 years ago, confirming an Early-Mid Weichselian age for the underlying glacial complex. The proxies used in the study include sedimentary facies, pollen data, plant macrofossils, oxygen isotope values, megafauna remains, insect assemblages, traces of DNA, paleosols, and permafrost properties. These proxies indicate a continental, progressively deteriorating climate with very cold winters and warmer summers during the second half of the Late Pleistocene. The study area is divided into two regions: periglacial European Russia and Siberia. While the former shows more pronounced changes in climate, the latter remains relatively stable and beneficial for biota despite increased continentality. The recent data accumulated by various researchers are incompatible with the conventional correlation of the Karginsky interglacial strata of Siberia with any part of the European Pleniglacial. Overall, the postglacial history of northern Eurasia is comprehensively studied only in the area of Fennoscandian glaciations, where it is relatively short, while the larger and older part of the Eurasian North remains less known."}

Earthquake loading can generate significant excess pore water pressures at depth, leading to instability of the slope during or after the event. A new simplified model for clays is proposed to analyze seismic triggering mechanisms of landslide initiation, which predicts realistic variations of stress-strain-strength relationships and pore pressure generation during dynamic loading in simple shear. The model is implemented in a finite element program to assess the critical depth and estimated displacements of mobilized materials, which are important components for estimating submarine landslide-induced tsunamis."}

The study included nine streams in each region, corresponding to natural, suburban-urban, and agricultural land uses. The researchers used structural equation modeling to test a causal model that included ecosystem metabolism, hydraulic parameters, and nitrogen concentration. They compared this model to multiple regression models that included additional biotic, catchment, and riparian variables. The structural equation model explained 79% of the variation in log uptake length (SWtot). The study found that uptake length increased with specific discharge and NO3 concentrations, suggesting a loss in removal efficiency in streams with high NO3 concentration. Uptake lengths shortened with increasing gross primary production, indicating that autotrophic assimilation dominated NO3 removal. The study also found that land use indirectly affected NO3 uptake lengths by increasing both gross primary production and NO3 concentration. However, adding land use to the structural equation model showed that it had no net effect on NO3 removal."}

The solution uses the Pride et al. and Lafarge models to describe acoustic wave attenuation, which provide a better representation of wave loss compared to traditional models. Two additional parameters, p and p', are introduced to account for losses in the porous material, which are modified from the original coefficients. The resulting wave equation contains fractional derivative terms that describe both attenuation and dispersion in the porous material. The solution is validated through an experimental application on a porous plastic foam. The main finding is that the introduction of p and p' corrects the Johnson-Allard model by increasing attenuation without changing dispersion, which is more significant for resistive porous materials."}

The country faces water scarcity due to rapid urban growth over the past 40 years, leading to increasing water demand in major urban centres. However, the dominant water management approach focuses more on developing additional water supplies than conserving water. The study uses stakeholder theory to analyze the role of domestic consumers in urban water conservation, as there is little documented evidence on this topic in Botswana. The findings suggest that most households did not practice water conservation before 2004, except for temporary measures such as water restrictions and increased tariffs imposed by the Water Utilities Corporation.

This study examines fuelwood use over an 11-year period in five rural villages in South Africa, where electricity became widely available. The findings show that almost a decade after the introduction of electricity, over 90% of households still use fuelwood for cooking and heating, despite a policy of free electricity. The proportion of households purchasing fuelwood has increased due to factors such as scarcity, changes in species preferences, and lower prices compared to other fuels and inflation rate.

In the Arava Fault (AF) segment, fluid activity has not led to extensive cementation of fault damage zones, and strontium and carbon and oxygen isotopes indicate infiltration of predominantly meteoric fluids with only subordinate involvement of ascending hydrothermal fluids from deep sources. In contrast, the Serghaya Fault (SF) branch exhibits more intense alteration processes and fracture cementation, while the Ghab Fault (GF) segment shows an intermediate level of fluid-rock interactions. The d18O, strontium isotopes, and major and minor element contents of veins indicate near-surface meteoric fluids that show little or no interaction with carbonate host rocks in the SF and GF segments, while the AF segment shows a different mixing pattern between the fluid and the host rock. The variations in fluid-rock interactions along the DST are attributed to local variations in climate (precipitation)."}

They then calculate the elasticity of these couplings to seasonal scale forcings and train artificial neural networks to extrapolate these elasticities to the entire globe. The maps of estimated functional elasticity show that each ecosystem will respond uniquely to changing forcings, with tropical forests, hot deserts, savannas, and high elevations being the most elastic.

Seismic reflections indicate that the faults were active during deposition, but many became inactive later. The preservation of the Tarbert Formation in both footwall and hangingwall locations suggests that the rate of deposition balanced tectonic subsidence during the earliest synrift. Local space generated by hangingwall subsidence was superimposed upon accommodation due to a regional rise in relative sea-level. Transgression across the prerift coastal plain produced lagoons and bays, which became increasingly marine. Barrier islands moved landward across the drowned bays during continued transgression.

Previous analyses of these lakebed sediments showed a high amount of contaminant metals and As associated with sub-micron grains, making them difficult to analyze using standard methods. TEM offered great advantages in spatial resolution and was combined with other techniques to determine As speciation.

Killarney and Thompson Lakes experienced seasonal water-level fluctuations, leading to changes in oxygen content in sediment exposed during drawdown. In contrast, Swan Lake had relatively constant water levels, resulting in stable As hosts throughout the sediment profile.

They find that increased population structure leads to higher payoff outcomes even when risky strategies are adopted, and that large social groups can lead to anti-coordination when competition is strong. The authors also show how genetic relatedness affects the stochastically stable outcome of coordination games, with positive relatedness increasing the chance of a payoff dominant strategy being stochastically stable, while negative relatedness leads to a polymorphism between alternative strategies. Finally, they extend their results to large multiplayer games and find that negative relatedness can create competition so extreme that the game effectively becomes a hawk-dove game, leading to a stochastically stable polymorphism between the two strategies."}

Two climate-sensitive mechanisms are primarily responsible for these reductions: increased imbalance of evaporation relative to inflow, which concentrates solutes into smaller volumes, and accelerated permafrost degradation, which enhances sublacustrine drainage and leaches previously frozen solutes into lakes. The study documented changes in nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and ions (calcium, chloride, magnesium, and sodium) over a 25-year period in shrinking, stable, and expanding Subarctic lakes in the Yukon Flats, Alaska. Concentrations of all six solutes increased in shrinking lakes from 1985-1989 to 2010-2012, while stable or expanding lakes showed little change. The present-day pattern of higher solute concentrations in shrinking lakes is likely due to an imbalanced evaporation-to-inflow ratio, which positively correlated with isotopically derived E/I estimates for all four ions and the most conservative ion, chloride. The substantial increases in nutrients (>200%) and ions (>100%) may shift shrinking lakes towards overly eutrophic or saline states, with potentially severe consequences for lake ecosystems."}

The experiment involved plants cultivated up to 40 days after seed germination using nutrient solutions containing varying concentrations of ammonium (1-8 mmol L-1). The presence or absence of Si (at a concentration of 1 mmol L-1) was also included in the study. The accumulation and efficiency of nitrogen and Si use, as well as growth parameters such as leaf area and root dry biomass, were assessed. The results showed that the addition of Si increased the accumulation of nitrogen and Si, as well as the nitrogen use efficiency, root area, and dry biomass of the shoot. At concentrations of 1 and 2 mmol L-1 ammonium, Si also increased leaf area and root dry biomass. However, at higher concentrations, there was no effect of Si. The study suggests that Si can mitigate ammonium toxicity in tomato plants, particularly at lower concentrations of ammonium (1 mmol L-1). The use of beneficial elements such as Si is recommended to alleviate ammonium toxicity in plants."}

While there is a general correlation between these two factors, it can be misleading in terms of understanding elemental cycling processes and controls on storage of biogenic material. Deltaic environments have the highest rates of net sedimentation and are the most important class of depocenters on Earth. However, available data indicate that organic matter from both terrestrial and marine sources is efficiently decomposed in deltaic areas, with decomposition percentages reaching 70% and 90%, respectively. Despite high primary productivity associated with most deltas, patterns of sulfur reduction indicate that the reactivity of organic material being buried is low, and a larger proportion of organic matter is often degraded compared to other marine deposits. The efficient remineralization of organic matter in deltaic areas is attributed to intense physical reworking of sediment associated with estuarine fronts, upwelling, tidal oscillation, and wind-driven waves. These processes result in a decoupling of net accumulation and elemental cycling, with the continental shelves acting as massive fluidized bed reactors dominated by bacterial biomass. Similar processes occur in smaller scales in most estuarine-shelf systems, but are most dramatically expressed off major rivers forming deltas."}

They find that d34SCAS varied from +9% to +44% at rates up to 100 Myr-1 during the Griesbachian-Smithian substages of the Early Triassic. The study uses modeling to demonstrate that such rapid variation in the sulfur cycle required a drawdown of seawater sulfate concentrations and a reduction in its residence time, leading to positive covariation with d13Ccarb due to strong coupling of organic carbon and pyrite burial fluxes. The study also finds that carbon and sulfur isotopic shifts were associated with contemporaneous changes in climate, marine productivity, and microbial sulfate reduction rates, with negative shifts in d13Ccarb and d34SCAS linked to warming, decreased productivity, and reduced sulfate reduction.

The study suggests that the condensate field is a typical case of large-scale oil/gas field with multiple elements favoring its formation, including trap formation timing, trap and source rock stacking, and efficient hydrocarbon charge. The thick Paleogene gypsum beds act as an excellent cap rock, favoring the accumulation and preservation of the condensate."}

The study suggests that the Jurassic humic coals are not the only major source of oil discovered in the Taibei depression, but rather there are additional significant contributions from the Upper Permian and Middle-Lower Jurassic lacustrine source rocks. The Carboniferous-Permian marine source rocks may also have played a role in limited locations along major basement faults. The study uses molecular and petrographic data to indicate that the majority of the Middle Jurassic strata are immature or marginally mature with respect to hydrocarbon generation, but within major depocenters, the Middle-Lower Jurassic coal-bearing strata have reached the conventional oil window. Pre-Jurassic derived hydrocarbons are found in extracts of fractured Jurassic coal and fine-grained rocks, with large differences observed in the absolute concentrations of biomarker compounds in rock extracts of various source intervals. The study suggests that the \"coaly\" biomarker signatures of the oils likely resulted from mixing and migration contamination when hydrocarbons derived from mature source rocks migrated up through highly fractured coal seams along deep-seated faults. The article concludes that conventional exploration targets in the Turpan basin should include deep structures within the Carboniferous-Permian strata and subtle, low-magnitude anticlines and stratigraphic traps within the Triassic-Jurassic sections."}

They found that Alaskan caribou are subdivided into two clusters: one on the Alaska Peninsula with discrete herds and one large group on the Mainland without differentiation between many herds. The study identified several factors associated with genetic differentiation, including population size, geographic distance, migratory ecotype, and the Kvichak River. Contrary to previous hypotheses, small Mainland herds were often differentiated genetically from large interconnected herds nearby, suggesting that behavior may play a role in maintaining genetic differentiation between some herds of different ecotypes. The study found that Alaskan caribou show remarkable high diversity and low differentiation over a broad geographic scale, which has implications for the conservation of caribou and other migratory mammals threatened by population reductions and landscape barriers."}

The b-Lcy gene was modified to either up-regulate or down-regulate its expression in a fruit-specific manner. Three transformants with increased beta-carotene content were observed, resulting in different color phenotypes ranging from orange to orange-red. Fruits from transformants with reduced b-Lcy expression showed a slight increase in lycopene content and up to 50% inhibition of b-Lcy activity.

The study area contains 20-30m thick sequences of sand from the penultimate to last glacial periods, preserved within the buried palaeo-Scheldt Valley. The authors build on previous seismo- and lithostratigraphical studies and present new evidence from biostratigraphical analysis, OSL dating, and depth-converted structure maps, revealing a complex history of deposition and landscape evolution controlled by climate change, sea-level fluctuations, and glacio-isostasy. The study shows that the incised palaeo-Scheldt Valley landform developed towards the end of the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6; Saalian) due to glacio-isostatic forebulge updoming, proglacial lake drainage, and subsequent collapse of a forebulge between East Anglia and Belgium following ice-sheet growth, disintegration, and retreat in areas to the north. The majority of the incised-valley fill is of estuarine to shallow marine depositional context deposited during the transgression and high-stand of the last interglacial (MIS 5e; Eemian). A thin upper part of the valley fill consists of last glacial (MIS 5d-2; Weichselian) fluvial sediments that show a gradual decrease and retreat of fluvial activity to inland, upstream reaches of the valley system until finally the valley ceases to exist as the combined result of climate-driven aeolian activity and possibly also glacio-isostatic adjustment. The study highlights significant contrasts between the palaeo-Scheldt Valley and estuary systems of the penultimate glacial maximum, the beginning of the Last Glacial (Weichselian Early Glacial and Early-Middle Pleniglacial), and the Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene."}

In a ponderosa pine forest in Arizona, fire-scar data provided complete inventories of major fires but failed to detect small fires. There was a strong relationship between the percentage of samples recording fire scars in a given year and total area burned. Cumulative fire frequency maps interpolated from fire-scar data were found to have strong spatial coherence with ground-mapped fire perimeters. The study demonstrates that accurate landscape-scale fire histories can be reconstructed from spatially distributed fire scars, which is essential for understanding the long-term effects of fire and climate on ecosystem dynamics and guiding fire and forest restoration planning."}

The research presents data from a six-year seasonality study in a pasture woodland in southern England, analyzing earthworm diversity in relation to soil moisture and temperature. The results show seasonal patterns in the abundance of common earthworm species, with a maximum in March and a minimum in September. However, there is no significant overall trend in either climate data or earthworm species data. The study also notes changes in the distribution of two species, Dendrobaena octaedra and Dendrobaena attemsi, which may indicate a shift in their distribution due to climate variations. The endogeic worm species do not show the same seasonal pattern as the epigeic species, likely due to their ability to move freely through the soil and aestivate. The changes observed are attributed to a combination of human movement of earthworms and local climate variations."}

They use advanced well logging techniques to analyze the coal macrolithotypes and their responses to different stimuli. The results show that the density, ash yield, and mineral content of coals increase from bright to dull, while the vitrinite content and pore-fracture development degree decrease. The dull and semi-dull coals are found in contact with mudstone, while the bright coal occurs as an interlayer between them. The authors also develop structural models of the coal macrolithotypes, which show that fractures are controlled by tectonic stress fields and microfractures, while pores are multilevel and include protogenetic and secondary pores. The study finds that advanced logging techniques such as natural gamma-ray spectroscopy (NGS), formation microresistivity image (FMI), and cross-dipole array acoustic (XMAC) loggings are consistent with each other and with traditional logging responses such as natural gamma (GR) and interval transit time (AC). However, the FMI technique is prone to errors due to coal heterogeneity. The study concludes that understanding the coal macrolithotypes and their responses to different stimuli is crucial for optimizing coalbed methane (CBM) reservoir management."}

The authors use logging-while-drilling data from the northern Gulf of Mexico to develop a model for predicting permeability in hydrate-bearing sands based on clay-sized sediment fraction. They find that sands with a clay-sized fraction below 0.05 have high intrinsic permeability, which can support focused hydrate formation due to advection of methane from deeper sources or diffusion of microbial methane from nearby clay layers. In contrast, sands with higher clay content have lower permeability and less pronounced focused flow, suggesting that diffusion of dissolved microbial methane is the preferred mode of supply in these cases. The study highlights the importance of direct measurements of permeability in constraining fluid flow and pore pressure calculations, particularly in methane hydrate-bearing sediments where permeability can influence the localization of hydrates and the rate of methane flux."}

The compound is likely produced by diatoms living in the sea ice and may serve as a specific, sensitive, and stable proxy for sea ice in sediments over at least the Holocene. Through synthesis and comparison with sediment samples from an East-West transect in the Canadian Arctic, the team confirmed the identity of IP25 and demonstrated its potential as a tool for reconstructing past changes in sea ice extent. The compound has not been reported before, and its presence in older sediments dated to at least 9000 years ago suggests that it may be a useful proxy for monitoring movements in the position of the ice edge throughout the Holocene. The study's findings have implications for accurately calibrating climate prediction models, which rely on such proxies to reconstruct past climates. A similar approach could be applied to Antarctic samples of ice and sediments as well."}

The method is applied to estimate 20-yr return values of maximum daily temperature over Europe in transient global climate model (GCM) simulations for the 21st century. The results show that conventional stationary extreme value models may yield biased results when applied to non-stationary temperature data, while the non-stationary models lead to robust spatial patterns that enable the detection of areas with the largest projected warming in the distribution of extremes. The method also allows splitting the projected warming into two components: one related to changes in the location of extreme events and the other related to changes in their scale. The spatial patterns of these components differ significantly in the examined climate change projections over Europe. The article highlights the importance of estimating high quantiles of temperature distributions for practical purposes, such as dimensioning civil engineering works, in the context of a changing climate."}

Tidal pumping was identified as a driving force for SGD in both lagoons, accounting for approximately 10% of the total SGD flux into the lagoons. The study also reassessed the dissolved inorganic nutrient budgets in the two lagoons and found that SGD was the major source of nutrients entering the LY Lagoon, while the XH Lagoon behaved as a source for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), but a sink for dissolved silicate (DSi). The study highlights the importance of SGD in influencing the local ecological environment, particularly in coastal areas with abundant tropical ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, and sea grass beds. The estimation of nutrient fluxes via SGD can help recognize the importance of these ecosystems and develop methods for coastal environment management."}

The study found several GDGTs and strongly 13C-depleted biphytanes in the deep anoxic region of the Black Sea (>700 m), indicating AOM. However, this biomarker signal was not detected in the upper anoxic zone or the entire water column of the Cariaco Basin, despite previous studies showing high rates of AOM in both basins. The study suggests that either non-methanotrophic archaea may be utilizing 13C-enriched carbon substrates, masking the AOM-derived biomarker signal or the methanotrophic community in these basins is highly diverse, producing another suite of biomarkers that were not measured. Further testing is needed to confirm these findings."}

The study finds that Saharan-dominated WSOC have more intense fluorescence and higher content of reduced quinone-like fluorescent components than marine-dominated WSOC, and both particulate matter loading and molar absorption in the UV range are significantly related to iron content.

Uplift can be broadly classified into two categories: thermal uplift, which is driven by solar radiation heating the ground, and orographic uplift, which is generated by wind deflected over topographic features. Large soaring birds rely on thermals for uplift in flat terrain, while orographic uplift concentrates along ridgelines. Mountainous areas tend to have high uplift availability due to their ability to generate orographic uplift even in low-wind conditions or cool temperatures. The preferential use of areas with favorable uplift conditions can reduce the energetic costs of migration for soaring birds, as gained altitude via either uplift type represents a form of potential energy that reduces the need for powered flight and provides calorific savings."}
