The claims are owned entirely by Eagle Plains Resources Ltd. with no underlying royalties or encumbrances. There are two exploration targets on the Hall Lake property: an intrusion-related gold system and Sedimentary Exhalative (SedEx). In the late 1990s, the British Columbia Geological Survey recognized the potential of southern and southeastern British Columbia to host significant gold mineralization. Two styles of gold mineralization were identified in the region: distal sediment-hosted gold mineralization similar to Nevada's Carlin and related areas (Lefebure et al., 1998) and more proximal intrusive-related gold mineralization similar to Yukon and Alaska's Tintina Gold Belt (Logan, 2000). The Bayonne Plutonic Suite, which forms an arcuate belt roughly 50 to 75 km wide and extends from the Canada-USA border, is one of several Cretaceous plutonic suites in the Omineca tectonic belt that stretches for over 1600 km along the Canadian Cordilleran interior. These plutons are known to host or control large intrusive-related gold deposits, such as those found in Yukon and Alaska (e.g., Donlin Creek, Fort Knox, Ryan Lode, True North, Pogo, Brewery Creek, Dublin Gulch, etc.). The presence of both Cretaceous and Eocene plutonic suites on the Hall Lake property suggests the possibility of two distinct events of gold mineralization in the region. This is similar to the possible occurrence of two epochs of gold mineralization in the Great Basin, Nevada. As a result of this work, Eagle Plains' personnel identified the Hall Lake property as an excellent grassroots exploration target for these types of deposits."}

At least six companies have conducted exploration on the project, with Bravo Alaska Inc. obtaining most of the data from previous programs. The company has also conducted geologic mapping and sampling, which has led to new interpretations of the mineralizing controls and the potential to project gold mineralization into untested areas. A recommended 3,650-meter (12,000-foot) reverse-circulation drill program is proposed with an estimated cost of $300,000."}

The Project is located on the site of the previously operated Oracle Ridge copper mine, which was last operated from 1991 to 1996 and closed due to operating difficulties and low copper prices. ACS assumes that any mining operation at Oracle Ridge could operate year-round. The geology of the Project is within the Santa Catalina-Rincon Mountains metamorphic core complex. The Report outlines the history of the Project, including the previous operating history and current ownership structure. Additionally, the Report provides information on the geology, permitting, and potential risks associated with the Project."}

{"doc_id": "620d2304ad0e9c819b0626a4.json", "gpt_res": "The Beruang Kanan mineral deposit, located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, has been estimated to contain copper mineralization based on drill hole logging and sample assay databases. The resource estimate was conducted by KSK and joint venture partners using data analysis, triangulation domaining, block modeling, and grade interpolation. The 2017 resource model covers a strike extent of 1300m and width of 800m and defines the near-surface mineralization at Beruang Kanan Main Zone. While three deep holes failed to intersect significant copper mineralization, there are indications of repeat systems at depth. Copper mineralization occurs as covellite, chalcocite, bornite, and chalcopyrite replacement of pyrite in veins and less common fracture fill settings. The resource is hosted in both blocky fractured volcanics and sediments, with pervasive phyllic-style alteration throughout the prospect. A total of 267 diamond drill holes (43,440m) were used to underpin the resource model, with intercepted mineralization in 868 nominal 3m drill intervals (2486m) in historical drill holes, 1920 nominal 1m drill intervals (2377m) in holes drilled in 2015, and 5014 nominal 1m intervals (5131m) in holes drilled from 2016 to 2017."}

The purpose of the examination was to assess access, claims, geology, and sampling, as well as past and present property data. The author is a qualified person (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101. The properties are located in the Luning project area, which is situated in the Walker Lane, a major northwest trending belt of strike slip faulting near the western edge of the Basin and Range Province. The most common rocks in the project area are related to Tertiary volcanic events. The examination found that the properties were accurately located in the field and documented with the county and Bureau of Land Management offices. Soil sampling grids and rock sample locations were examined and found to be as reported. Sampling conducted by the author identified areas with geochemical and geological characteristics similar to deposits in the region, including the Rawhide-Denton Mine and the Isabella gold deposit. The Pinto property displayed antimony associated with a prominent structure that cuts sedimentary rocks resembling the setting of the Santa Fe deposit."}

The report provides a geologic and economic analysis of the property, which consists of over 7,155 hectares of staked and crown granted claims. The property is located approximately 36 km south of Houston and can be accessed through the Morice-Owen Forest Service road. Geologically, the area is underlain by a series of volcanic rocks and intrusions, including a sill-like body of microdiorite. Approximately 20 mineralized veins have been discovered on the property, with quartz veins being the most common type. The report suggests that there may be a deep and broad source of mineralizing solutions and a replacement-type sulphide body, with pyrite-sphalerite-chalcopyrite and sphalerite-galena being the two main types of sulphide mineralization. Good gold and silver values are associated with the chalcopyrite-sphalerite veins. The gangue is primarily composed of cherty quartz, carbonate minerals, barite, and pyrobitumen. Local intense alteration of wallrock along veins and fissures has resulted in a mixture of clay and carbonate minerals, some chlorite, minor epidote, and other sulphide minerals."}
