The analysis indicates that there are two types of carbonate decomposition occurring at different temperatures: high-temperature decomposition consistent with calcite, dolomite, or ankerite, and low-temperature decomposition consistent with magnesite or siderite. The presence of these carbonates suggests that the soil pH is favorable for microbial activity throughout the Martian northern plains. The detection of calcium carbonate and possibly iron and magnesium carbonate by Phoenix-TEGA was based on interpretations referenced to standard thermal analysis literature on carbonates. The findings are consistent with the idea that carbonates are more widespread on Mars than previously thought, and provide evidence for multiple formation pathways at the Phoenix Landing site."}

Using orbital data, researchers mapped and analyzed the crater's infillings to determine their origin. The sediment of Aeolis Mons is believed to be primarily composed of air fall material such as dust, volcanic ash, fine-grained impact products, and possibly snow deposited by settling from the atmosphere, as well as wind-blown sands cemented in the crater center. Unconformity surfaces between the geological units indicate depositional hiatuses. Crater floor material deposited around Aeolis Mons and on the crater wall is interpreted to be alluvial and colluvial deposits. Morphological evidence suggests that a shallow lake existed after the formation of the lowermost part of Aeolis Mons, with features such as patterned ground and possible rock glaciers indicative of periglacial processes in a permafrost environment after the first hundreds of thousands of years following its formation, dated to ~3.61 Ga in the Late Noachian/Early Hesperian. Episodic melting of snow in the crater could have led to the formation of sulfates and clays in Aeolis Mons, as well as the formation of rock glaciers and deep canyons and valleys along the crater's flanks and rim, and a shallow lake in the deepest portions of Gale."}

The area offers unique opportunities to study changes in surface composition due to different stratigraphic levels of Ceres' crust. The depression is possibly a completely degraded impact basin formed at the beginning of Ceres' geological history, and it is characterized by strong phyllosilicate absorptions that are stronger than elsewhere on Ceres' surface. These spectral signatures may be related to material emplaced during the Vendimia impact event, which excavated material from deeper regions of Ceres' crust. Subsequent impacts in this basin reached far deeper into Ceres' crust than any impact events outside of Vendemia Planitia, which could explain the spectral signature of Dantu and potentially point to a higher concentration of ammonium-bearing phyllosilicates in Ceres' deeper crust. The text also notes that the local enrichment of carbonates in the Dantu area could be associated with the impact event and may have been formed by additional impact-triggered and/or post-impact alteration processes. The composition of Ceres' surface is found to be quite variable on a regional and local scale, which could indicate a vertically stratified upper crust or result from specific surface processes. To improve understanding of compositional variations in Ceres' crustal material, the Dawn Science Team conducted a campaign for mapping the spectral properties of Ceres' surface based on data acquired by the spacecraft's instruments."}

The thermal inertia of a planetary surface is a complex function of regolith thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat. When a planet has an atmosphere, the conductivity of the surface must account for both the solid component and the atmospheric gas in the interstitial pore spaces. On Mars, variations in thermal inertia and conductivity affect the areas where surface temperatures exceed the melting point of water, which is necessary but not sufficient for surface liquid water. Past Mars climate models have neglected the potential role of interstitial atmospheric gas as a thermally conducting element of the surface, but this underestimation has no significant impact on past Mars climate models. Changes in obliquity and orbital variations will also modify surface thermal properties, leading to variations in surface conductivity and thermal inertia on timescales of 105-107 years. These variations should not be neglected, and the potential for liquid water at the surface may increase with time following large positive excursions in Mars' obliquity."}

The study by Neil Krystopowicz and Claire Currie at the University of Alberta, Canada, uses numerical modeling to simulate the formation of a mountain range as two tectonic plates converge. The model shows that the deep crustal root of a mountain belt can become so dense that it breaks away and sinks into the underlying mantle, causing localized deformation at the surface and promoting further crustal thickening and eclogitization. The study suggests that the eclogitic root is denser than the underlying mantle, which causes it to sink further into the mantle. This process leads to abrupt uplift at the surface and hot mantle welling upwards in the wake of the sinking crustal root.\n\nIn a separate study, Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez-Moreno of the Universidad de Granada, Spain, and colleagues reconstructed the climate 6 million years ago when the water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea closed down, leading to the desiccation of the Mediterranean.

The age of these sites is over 3 billion years old. The detection of nontronite provides an integrated record of processes in near-surface environments, including pedogenesis and diagenesis. The study measured dissolution rates of nontronite in column reactors at different solution pH values and flow rates, revealing that nontronite dissolves stoichiometrically at pH values of 0.9 and 1.7, but non-stoichiometrically at pH value of 3.0. The results suggest that once nontronite forms, it can remain stable at or near the surface of Mars for extended periods of time. Additionally, the study found that nontronite dissolution rates are slower than the dissolution rates of primary phases present in basalt under acidic conditions, indicating that chemical weathering of a mixed clay deposit would enrich the proportions of montmorillonite and kaolinite through the preferential dissolution of nontronite. The study also observed the precipitation of amorphous silica within columns and association with phyllosilicates on the martian surface, providing a potential formation mechanism for the mineralogic stratigraphy observed at Mawrth Vallis and other locations on Mars."}

The interpretation of these reflections as indicating the presence of water-saturated materials or ponded liquid water has been questioned, and other explanations for the source of the bright basal reflections have been proposed. The article presents laboratory measurements, simulations, and previous published data that demonstrate that the dielectric properties of clay, hydrated salts, and saline ices do not generate strong basal reflections at MARSIS frequencies and Martian temperatures. The most plausible explanation for the bright basal reflections is the presence of perchlorates and chlorides brines, which exhibit a strong dielectric response at much lower temperatures than other materials. This interpretation suggests that metastability could be maintained for a long period of time on a geological scale. The article also discusses the presence of hydrous minerals and salts on Mars, which have been found in samples of Martian meteorites and detected through orbital and lander observations. Quantitative analysis based on Curiosity rover measurements indicates an amount of clay minerals ranging between 3 and 28% in fluvio-lacustrine sediments of Gale Crater, mainly containing smectite (nontronite, saponite) and chlorite. Thermal infrared spectra indicate a clay abundance of about 15% in the southern highlands, while the amounts of clays do not exceed 30% in Nili Fossae, Tyrrhena Terra, and Terra Sirenum.

The study aims to constrain the timescales of coating development, growth rates, and factors controlling lateral coating heterogeneity. The researchers sampled and analyzed young lava flows (of varying ages) along K\u012blauea's southwest and east rift zones to characterize variation in silica coating properties across the landscape. They found that coating thickness varies with flow age, flow surface type, and proximity to acid sources like local fissure vents and regional plumes emitted from K\u012blauea Caldera and Pu'u \u014c'\u014d. The study reveals that silica coatings form preferentially on flow surfaces with glassy outer layers, such as spatter ramparts, volcanic bombs, and dense pahoehoe breakouts, due to glass strain weakening during cooling.

The authors propose a methane burst scenario as a potential pathway for intermittent excursions to a warm, wet climate state on early Mars. They use numerical simulations to show that outgassed methane can build up to atmospheric levels sufficient for lake-forming climates if methane clathrate initially occupies more than 4% of the total volume in which it is thermodynamically stable.

The presence of these expanded craters indicates that excess ice is still preserved within the adjacent terrain. The study measures the size distribution of superposed expanded craters and uses topographic data to calculate crater volumes as a proxy for the volumes of ice lost to sublimation during the expansion process. The inner ejecta layer contains craters that appear to have undergone more expansion, suggesting that excess ice was most abundant in that region. However, both ejecta layers had more expanded craters than the surrounding terrain, indicating a significant quantity of ice remains within the entire ejecta deposit.

The interaction between water and highly chemically reactive glassy fragments could have been common in Mars' early history, leading to widespread occurrence of smectitic clay. Basaltic volcanism on Mars would have been more explosive than on Earth due to lower gravity and crustal pressures. Extensive layered, easily eroded, and fine-grained deposits are found throughout ancient terrains on Mars."}

These modifications include the presence of extensive fractures arranged in a concentric pattern, forming moats that engulf the old crater wall. The text suggests that these modifications are more diverse on Mars than on the moon and are closely associated with major regional features and provinces. The authors propose that floor-fractured craters represent sites of late-stage and widespread pulse of igneous activity, which may have thawed ground ice and resulted in the observed modification styles. They also suggest that identified multiring basins are broader scale control of igneous processes by old impact structures. The text highlights the contrast between the well-preserved state of the concentric graben and the highly degraded state of the original impact structure, suggesting that structural modification postdates a long history of degradation by erosion or lava flooding."}

However, these microborings have not been observed in continental basalts that were not erupted in marine or subglacial settings. To expand the record of endolithic microborings to non-marine, continental lacustrine environments, researchers examined hydrovolcanic pyroclastic deposits in the Fort Rock volcanic field in central Oregon. The study found various tubular and granular textures with biogenic morphologies and behaviors, as well as a primary geological context that indicates their age and syngenicity. Petrographic relationships with secondary phases (chabazite, nontronite, calcite) suggest that microtunnel construction occurred in saline, alkaline fluids at temperatures of 25-80\u00b0C. Positive correlations were also found between the extent of aqueous alteration and both the abundance of microtunnels and morphological type, suggesting that microtunnels were more readily formed where there was greater abiotic alteration-fluid flux, and that the resulting change in chemical composition of those fluids may have had a direct influence on the formation process or possibly the type of constructing microbe. This work adds to understanding of factors controlling microtunnel formation and is the first to do so in continental lacustrine environments."}

The results show that the labradorite mineral in the unshocked basalt is replaced by diaplectic glass (maskelynite) due to shock metamorphism. The TIR spectrum of class 2 shocked basalt is similar to that of the Los Angeles shergottite, indicating that the mineralogy of these two samples is similar. Additionally, the authors found that adding experimentally shocked plagioclase feldspars as TIR end-members improves the fits and lowers the RMS errors for the deconvolution of the TIR spectrum of the maskelynite-bearing impactite. They also identified three differences in spectral features between two class 5 spectral types, which they attribute to incomplete melting in the class 5A samples. These samples represent excellent analogs for Martian shocked basalt and new lithologic end-members for use in spectral libraries used to analyze TIR data from Mars."}

The simulated storms exhibited significant increases in atmospheric dustiness, global-mean air temperatures, and atmospheric circulation intensity, consistent with observations. The model showed that spontaneous initiation of storms occurs in southern spring and summer, with years having no storms interspersed with years with storms of varying sizes and specific seasonal dates of initiation. The authors found that surface wind stresses associated with large-scale wind systems initiate the storms, which are linked to the seasonally migrating CO2 cap boundary and sloping topography of the Hellas basin, thermal tides, and traveling waves. A limited number of large storms begin with lifting along frontal zones associated with traveling waves in the northern hemisphere, leading to explosive growth through intensification of the Hadley circulation and activation of secondary dust-lifting centers. The study supports the idea that variable and spontaneous global dust storm behavior can emerge from a periodically forced system when the dust injection mechanism involves an activation threshold."}

They attribute this to the rugged terrain of these bodies, which prevents craters from forming with extremely high ellipticities. The authors also reexamine the martian crater population and find that it is consistent with the other planets, with a low percentage of craters formed by inward-spiraling moonlets.

Three formation mechanisms have been proposed to explain this correlation: pre-impact aqueous alteration exposed by the impact (pre-impact; Bibring et al., 2006), heat generated from the impact facilitating hydrothermal activity (syn-impact; e.g. Marzo et al., 2010), and/or deposited materials after crater formation or within the crater (post-impact). In this study, the central uplift of Elorza Crater is analyzed to determine if hydrated minerals were generated pre-, syn-, or post-impact. The study uses a data synthesis approach with HiRISE, CRISM, CTX, and THEMIS imagery. Opaline silica is observed in two locations on the southwestern side of the uplift, which may have formed through hydrothermal alteration due to stratigraphic relationships with the overlying impact melt unit. Both Fe/Mg smectite and low-calcium pyroxene (LCP) are found throughout the uplift, with bedrock exposures on the northern wall of Coprates Chasma containing Fe/Mg smectite and LCP suggesting an uplifted origin for these units. The possibility of an impact-generated hydrothermal origin cannot be ruled out, and the near-subsurface consists of Hesperian-aged discontinuous lava/ash deposits interposed with opaline silica-bearing deposits overlying Noachian basement consisting of smectite-bearing bedrock and LCP-bearing light-toned fractured bedrock."}

The authors compare terrestrial and Martian satellite images and examine the geological settings of mud volcano provinces on Earth to identify potential target areas for piercement structures on Mars. They suggest that studying these formations could provide samples of otherwise inaccessible strata, which could contain astrobiological evidence.

The temperatures range from 130 to 290 K (-140\u00b0C to -18\u00b0C) and are mapped according to their geologic units. An equatorial map of bolometric albedo is also created, which ranges from 0.09 to 0.43. The photometric behavior suggests a quasi-Lambertian surface reflectance with a strongly forward-scattering atmosphere. Brightness temperatures at large emission angles are influenced by atmospheric infrared opacity and the presence of rocks on the surface. The correlation and grouping of albedo and thermal inertia indicate two major components of Martian surface material, with bright regions having a fine particulate covering. Winter polar temperatures show spatial and temporal variations, suggesting variation of atmospheric composition; a strong atmospheric temperature inversion exists above the south polar cap during winter. Surface CO condensation may also occur locally near the equator before dawn. Rising temperatures before dawn in a region near Arsia Mons imply the presence of daily local water ice fogs. The study highlights the importance of surface temperature data for interdisciplinary studies of Mars, as they provide inputs for various meteorological systems and are directly tied to ambient pressures and temperatures at the surface. The full variability of surface thermal behavior will greatly increase the complexity of global circulation model calculations, and departures from lateral thermal homogeneity give rise to disk-integrated brightness temperature variations that may amount to several degrees Kelvin. The practice of using Mars as a calibration standard must be considered suspect until latitudinal, longitudinal, and possibly seasonal variations of thermal properties are taken into account."}

The study uses a new global geologic map of Mars at a scale of 1:20 million, as well as a complete crater data set and topography data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter. The research shows that the Early Noachian highland unit is nearly saturated with craters of 32-128 km diameter, while the Middle Noachian highland unit has a resurfacing age of around 4 billion years ago. The Late Noachian highland unit includes younger composite surfaces of basin fill and partially buried cratered terrain. The study also finds that crater depth/diameter ratios do not vary strongly between the Early and Middle Noachian units, although crater losses to Noachian resurfacing appear greater in lower-lying areas. The research suggests that Noachian resurfacing was spatially non-uniform, long-lived, and gravity-driven, and more consistent with arid-zone fluvial and aeolian erosion and volcanism than with air fall mantling or mass wasting. Additionally, the study finds that relict impact craters from the Noachian Period have reworked ejecta blankets, reduced rims, gullied interior walls, low-gradient to flat floors, and partly to wholly buried central peaks. Some craters contain predominantly volcanic or aeolian fill materials, while others are modified by post-Noachian, ice-facilitated mass wasting and mantling. Finally, the study notes that most counts of impact craters superimposed on valley networks record a timing of dissection around the Noachian/Hesperian transition, although some fluvial activity appears to have occurred later."}

Faint potential chloride signatures were detected at two RSL sites, but emissivity spectra showed no significant variation from surrounding geology. No other RSL showed indications of chlorides. The upper limit of chloride required for positive detection is estimated to be around 30-15 g/m, and the total brine required to produce a detectable lag deposit is around 80-35 mL/m at a eutectic concentration of calcium chloride. These results suggest that chloride abundance is not the limiting factor for RSL generation. Instead, RSL could be produced by capillary wicking of chloride-rich brines to the surface, where small amounts of brine produce lag deposits below the detection limits of currently orbiting instruments. The presence of liquid water on the surface of Mars has significant geologic and astrobiological implications, including the formation of valley networks, paleolakes, channels, deltas, and gullies.

While sulfates can form under various alteration conditions, palagonitelike mineral assemblages require low-temperature and high water-to-rock hydrothermal conditions similar to those found in subglacial or subaqueous volcanic eruptions. The possible palagonite detections on the volcanic edifices, the geomorphology of the region, and the analogous terrestrial mineralogy of subglacial eruptions suggest that these minerals formed during subglacial eruptions or associated hydrothermal systems.

The analysis suggests that the sediments in the crater basin are likely part of an ancient deposit of aeolian volcaniclastic material, with some erosion occurring since then. Dust devil tracks form during spring and summer, with most of the transport pathway delivering sand to the dune field coming from the southwest. The study also found that the large dark dunes contain few dust devil tracks, indicating that accumulated dust is swept away directly by saltation rather than by the passage of dust devils.

The spectral albedo curves obtained for 150 mare and desert areas showed that the surfaces fall into two well-defined and fairly uniform color-albedo groups corresponding to mare and desert units. The lack of distinctively different areas suggests that Mars' surface consists of only two types of materials. Laboratory comparison data support a model of the Martian regolith, where the general color is due to a limonite stain coating particles of lithic soils. Color differences between the two units in the 1-\u2022m region indicate that the proposed lithic soils of the maria are richer in pyroxene, olivine, or both than the lithic soils of the deserts. Features in the spectral albedo curves at 1.6 and 2.1 tzm are interpreted as being due to the I-I,O ice on the surface or in the Martian atmosphere.

The Smoking Hills are characterized by auto-combusting pyritic mudstones that have created extensive jarosite-rich deposits and banded jarosite- and phyllosilicate-rich mudstones. These formations are similar to those observed on Mars, leading the authors to suggest that the Smoking Hills may be a more habitable environment than previously interpreted for Mars. The study area is located along the western side of Franklin Bay, with autocombustion occurring along sea cliffs and continual combustion occurring until present. The authors presume that auto-combustion in the study area postdates deglaciation around 14,000 years ago."}

The RLS will perform measurements on crushed powdered samples inside the rover's Analytical Laboratory Drawer, and the data obtained is expected to be difficult to interpret. To optimize the detection of both minerals and biological markers, the study focused on b-carotene present in cyanobacteria. Measurement parameters such as measurement time per spectrum and number of measurements at one point were derived, and a measurement regime was proposed for mineral mixtures with cyanobacteria based on the RLS instrument characteristics. Analogue materials for martian regolith were produced by mixing terrestrial igneous rocks, phyllosilicates, carbonates, sulfates, and iron oxides, which are similar to those identified in martian meteorites and recent Mars orbiter and rover missions. The two different mineral and rock mixtures (P-MRS and S-MRS) reflect the current understanding of environmental changes on Mars, including weathering or hydrothermal alteration of crystal rocks and secondary mineralization during the Noachian and Hesperian epochs, followed by cold and dry oxidizing conditions leading to the formation of anhydrous iron oxides."}

The region has a thinner crust and massive phyllosilicate-bearing materials, which are still debated to have originated from large-scale volcanism and extensive denudation primarily controlled by fluvial activity. The study of the oldest channels in Arabia Terra is crucial for understanding the global geological evolution of early Mars. The reactivation of the hydrological system by sapping followed by aeolian erosion reshaped the channel, exposed ancient materials and landforms, and formed the current Coogoon Valles configuration. A complex system of deltas and alluvial fans is located at the termination of this channel, which has been proposed as a landing site for upcoming missions like ExoMars and Mars 2020."}

These clusters were plotted as global maps and interpreted for geological variations in the CRISM data. The study identified several previously recognized compositional distinct regions, such as the Northern Lowlands, Southern Highlands, Meridiani Planum, Syrtis Major, and Nili Fossae, as well as new clusters such as Solis Planum, Ophir Planum, and Hellas Basin. The researchers found that some of these clusters correspond to known geological units, but the interpretation of the spectral variability is uncertain whether it relates to geological or external factors such as the atmosphere and dust coverage.

The authors also identify a bright mound on the trough floor with spectral features characteristic of polyhydrated sulfates. They conclude that there were multiple periods of aqueous activity and alteration within the trough from the Late Hesperian to the Amazonian, which may have occurred contemporaneously with late aqueous activity elsewhere on Mars. The study suggests that the different minerals found in the trough require different aqueous conditions, such as high silica availability for opal and high calcium availability for gypsum, which were present in the past but not always together."}

The results support the interpretation that Mars' rocks record intermittent liquid-water runoff during a long interval of sedimentary rock emplacement.

The current study presents evidence of localized alteration of the northeast Nili Fossae capping unit, which was previously considered unaltered. Near-infrared and thermal-infrared spectral datasets were analyzed using a method to determine the relative abundance of bulk silica (SiO2) over surfaces using thermal emission imaging system (THEMIS) images. Elevated bulk silica exposures were found on surfaces previously defined as unaltered capping rock. The lack of spectral evidence for phyllosilicate, hydrated silica, or quartz phases coincident with the newly detected exposures suggests that the elevated bulk silica may have formed through various aqueous scenarios, including the carbonation of the underlying olivine-rich basalt under moderate water: rock scenarios and temperatures. The detection of elevated bulk silica exposures in the Nili Fossae capping unit extends the history of aqueous activity in the region to include all three of the main stratigraphic units."}

They compare the observed admittance signatures to those predicted from models of lithospheric flexure and obtain best fit elastic thickness estimates between 10 and 25 km, with an acceptable error range of 0 to 45 km. These low elastic thickness estimates are consistent with the formation in the Noachian, when heat flow was high, and suggest that both the Noachian highlands and lowlands basement formed at similar times. The lack of crustal magnetization in the lowlands is more likely due to demagnetization than formation following shut down of the dynamo."}

Observations of Venus at ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths have revealed that the planet's prominent markings are related to cloud movements and intense convection zones. Scientists were able to map upwellings and downflows, as well as vast hurricane-like vortices around the poles. The ultraviolet emission is attributed to an unknown species in the atmosphere, and sulphur compounds may be important due to the abundance of volcanic activity on the surface.\n2. A distant galaxy has been found to contain water, which is the most distant water detected in the universe. The galaxy, called MG J0414+0534, has a quasar at its core, and the water was detected through its amplifying effect on the quasar emission. However, the extreme age and distance of the galaxy means that the characteristic 22.2 GHz signal of a water maser was Doppler shifted to 6.1 GHz.\n3. Carbonates have been discovered by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\u2019s Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) in bedrock layers around the Isidis impact basin. The best-exposed rocks occur along a 700 km long trough system called Nili Fossae. The combination of spectroscopy and detailed imaging provided by MRO allows for the identification of these minerals and specific details of the rock formations, which are essential for interpretation.\n\nIn summary, these studies have shed light on various phenomena in our solar system, including the mysterious markings on Venus, the presence of water in a distant galaxy, and the tectonics of Saturn's moon Enceladus."}

The rocks in the area are dark, fine-grained basalts, and the upper 10 meters of the cratered plains appear to be an impact-generated regolith developed over intact basalt flows. Systematic field observations have revealed vesicular clasts and rare scoria similar to the original lava flow tops, suggesting an upper inflated surface of lava flows with adjacent collapse depressions. The crater and hollow morphometry suggests that most are secondary craters.

The study proposes three hypotheses for why the clay minerals are not apparent in thermal infrared data, including effects due to surface roughness, sub-pixel mixing of multiple surface temperatures, and low absolute mineral abundances combined with differences in spatial sampling between instruments.

To address the challenges of mapping these small landforms over large areas, a grid-based mapping approach has been developed. This involves dividing the study area into a grid of squares (e.g. 20 km by 20 km), systematically examining the basemap data within each grid square at full resolution to identify landforms and record their presence or absence. The result is a series of grids showing the distribution of all the mapped landforms across the study area, which can be overlaid on context maps to create a coarse digital landform map.

Some of the dark material may also be covered with dust, either thinly or in thicker patches. The thermal properties of the dark material are consistent with a mixture of sand, rock, and bedrock, while the rest of the crater floor has thermal characteristics of fine particulates. Spectral data indicate that the crater floor is covered by a layer of dust similar to the globally homogenized surface dust in other high-albedo regions on Mars.

The article presents evidence from the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer on board the Mars Express spacecraft, which has acquired thousands of Martian spectra in the range of 1.2\u201345 lm since January 2004. The spectra show a weak absorption feature between 3.8 and 4 lm, similar to one observed from Earth but with an uncertain origin. The article demonstrates that the surficial nature of this band can be ascribed to Mg-rich carbonates (huntite and/or magnesite) mixed with Martian soil materials. An evaluation of the likeliest abundance gives an upper limit of 10% for the presence of carbonates, which supports scenarios suggesting that they formed through weathering processes rather than precipitation in a water-rich environment.

The composition and structure of these minerals change with pressure and temperature, which is important for reconstructing the P-T paths of metamorphic rocks and interpreting geophysical data in subduction zones. Displacive transitions observed through experiments or DFT calculations may alter the thermodynamic properties of magnesian phyllosilicates, but their impact on first-order thermodynamic properties is generally small. Raman spectroscopy is a valuable tool for identifying these minerals in hydrated metabasites or ultrabasites, as it provides distinct and complex spectra that allow for easy identification. High-pressure measurements are in good agreement with DFT calculations for talc and lizardite, while pressure-induced displacive modifications are identified in lizardite and antigorite serpentines, and in chlorite at specific pressures. At high temperatures, the high-pressure distortions of serpentines shift to higher pressures. None of these high-pressure distortions are likely to occur at depth in the Earth, given the stability limits of these minerals and the natural range of P-T conditions.

The study highlighted the importance of accurate topographic information for all phases of Mars exploration and scientific investigation, including landing site selection and quantitative analysis of surface processes."}

The researchers characterized the secondary mineralogy and local variables, such as temperature, pH, rock and gas composition, and fluid-rock ratio, in three acidic volcanic systems: Cerro Negro, Momotombo, and Telica. They found that these environmental parameters have strong controls on the alteration mineralogy, with different settings resulting in different mineral compositions. The hottest and most acidic systems contained sulfur, silica, and minor gypsum, while moderately acidic and cooler fumaroles included abundant silica, gypsum, and other hydrated sulfates, and phyllosilicates. The study provides a conceptual framework for interpreting similar relic environments on Mars and highlights the importance of considering environmental controls on acid-sulfate alteration in understanding the formation of secondary minerals."}
